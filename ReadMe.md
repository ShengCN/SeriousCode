# Introduction
This is a 3D game using Panda3D engine as game engine and Bullet Engine as our physical engine. 

We developed this game for one month, including designing and preparing this game. Our team has six people. I was the tech leader of our team and implemented the development related to game engine and physical engine. To be specific, I designed the architecture of our game, collision detection module, battle logic module and the control module. Also, I was in charge of the refactor of our project and the final integration work.
